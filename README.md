# bananapi-radiation-monitor

**Inspired by the raspberry PI project https://bigpi.vc/build-a-simple-radiation-monitor-using-a-raspberry-pi-influxdb-and-grafana/ .**

A simple Python application to measure and record background radiation in your area. Radiation is detected with a cheaply available board, and connected to a Banana Pi M2 ZERO SBC (BPI-M2) to provide InfluxDB for data-logging and Grafana for pretty charts. Measured data are stored locally to BPI-M2.

The main motivation for the implementation of this project was the lack of chips for the production Raspberry Pi boards. last but not least, their price. Most of Raspebrry Pi boards will be available maybe by the end of the year 2023, currently are out of stock over the world. 

Banana Pi SBCs are compatible with Raspberry Pi SBC. But this is mostly only desire. The GPIO should be compatible with Raspberry Pi and can run Raspberry Pi images directly, but in my experience this is miles away from reality. GPIO hardware compatibility is very close to RaspberryPI, but some important libraries only support the BCM chips used in the manufacture of RaspberryPI boards and are not implementable on BananaPi. Anyway, for me are Bananapi SBCs very good, powerful and suitable product and the price-performance ratio is unprecedented.

## Hardware requirements

* A Banana Pi M2 ZERO SBC (BPI-M2) (any model should be suitable, I have used one of simplest BPI-M2 ZERO)
* An 8GB (or larger) SD card 
* A power supply (PSU)
* A radiation detector [Banggood](https://www.banggood.com/sk/DIY-Geiger-Counter-Kit-Open-Source-Miller-Tube-GM-Tube-Module-Radiation-Parts-p-1937604.html?rmmds=myorder&cur_warehouse=CN) , as kit for more skils users, or on  [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32884861168.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.5faf6aa9OuQXsc)
* Some [Dupont cables/jumper jerky](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/jumper-jerky?variant=348491271) (you’ll need 3 female-female cables)


## Hardware connection

There are 3 connections we need to make from the radiation detector board to the BPI-M2 ZERO. They are +5V and Ground (GND) for power, and the output pulse line to detect the pulses generated by detection board. Note that this is called `VIN` which can be a bit confusing as this usually means ‘voltage input’ or something similar, but on this board, it’s the output.

In this configuration you only need to provide 5 volt power to one of the two boards; if you’re powering the Banana Pi with a standard micro-USB power supply, that will power the detector board via the connections we’ve just made, as well.

## Software setup

You have two options. The first (preferred) is to download a prepared image with preset values. Or install some debian based image on your BPI-M2 zero , install the necessary software components and run my python application, stored in src directory. The first option is the easiest.

### How to use image:

Just download [geiger.img](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pP6zhLzigkKEu4Vl4GHI0awQZ6XYNu6-/view?usp=sharing) and burn it on the SD card. To do it, You need some suitable software to upload the img to the sd card, for example [BalenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher), or [Win32DiskImager](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/), or something similar, or the dd command in Linux CLI:

  *sudo dd if=geiger.img of=/dev/mmcblkx*             
  
  where mmcblkx must be replaced with appropriate name of SD card on your system.

Insert prepared SD card to your BPI-M2 and plug power, system should start. After time You can configure geiger counter under Your needs trough console or via WiFi. If you use console just log in as root user. If you decide to use Wifi, wireless adapter on BPI-M2 is preconfigured as AP (access point) with BSSID _**geiger**_ and password _**12345678**_. just connect to this AP from your computer  and find out IP address of BPI-M2 from your DHCP server. Now you can use SSH client on your PC for login BPI-M2 on IP address 10.1.1.1.
There are two system users defined. User _**root**_ and user _**pi**_. Both of them are set _**bananapi**_ password. After login , another steps are required. First of all:

**Is strongly recommended to change passwords after first login due to security.**  

Using the utility *armbian-config* change your wireless mode to client and connect BPI-M2 to your existing wireless network as client, or change secrets in file */etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf*. If you change wireless mode to client do not forget stop and disable DHCP server service. You can do it by

*systemctl disable isc-dhcp-server.service   
systemctl stop isc-dhcp-server.service*

Now is system ready to harvest radiation in your locality every minute and write values to the [InfluxDB database](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/) as time series. Predefined database is *geiger* and two users are defined to full database access. User *admin* with *admin* password and user *geiger* with password *geiger*.  

Drawing graphs and visualization measurements are provided by [Grafana](https://grafana.com/). Just run internet any browser , e.g. in mobile phone an connect to:   

*http://IP_address_BPI-M2:3000*    

login screen appear. You can log in as user *admin* with password *admin* for full access rights, or as user *viever* with password *viewer* for view graphs with restricted rights. 

Some of user parameters can be changed in */home/pi/geiger/config.py* file. You can change measurement interval *geiger_measure_int* . Stored values is in seconds. Divider is value represent relation between CPM (count impulses per minute) value and uSiviert value and depend on used type of geiger tube. *geiger_gpio_line* is set to 6 and represent GPIO port on BPI-M2. You can change it under your needs, but keep in mind, **that port you choose must support hardware interrupt.**


### How to install manually:

* Take BPI-M2 ZERO or similar (I have probed and tested it only on BananaPi M2 ZERO)
* install debian Linux (Armbian, Ubuntu, ...)
* install InfluxDb
* install grafana-server
* download \*.py files from *src* directory
* change content of configuration file \*.py files (config.py) under your database and hardware settings
* run application with *python3 counter.py*
