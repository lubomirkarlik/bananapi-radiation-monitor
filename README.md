# bananapi-radiation-monitor

**This is inspired by https://bigpi.vc/build-a-simple-radiation-monitor-using-a-raspberry-pi-influxdb-and-grafana/ raspberry PI project.**

A simple Python application to measure and record background radiation in your area. Radiation is detected with a cheaply available board, and connected to a Banana Pi M2 ZERO SBC (BPI-M2) to provide InfluxDB for datalogging and Grafana for pretty charts. Measured data are stored localy to BPI-M2.

The main motivation for the implementation of this project was the lack of chips for the production Raspberry Pi boards. last but not least, their price. Most of Raspebrry Pi boards will be available maybe by the end of the year 2023, currently are out of stock over the world. 

Banana Pi SBCs are compatible with Raspberry Pi SBC. But this is mostly only desire. The GPIO ishould be compatible with Raspberry Pi and can run Raspberry Pi images directly, but in my experience this is miles away from reality. GPIO hardware compatitibility is very close to RaspberryPI, but some important libraries only support the BCM chips used in the manufacture of RaspberryPI boards and are not implementable on BananaPi. Anyway, for me are Bananpi SBCs very good, powerful and suitable product and the price-performance ratio is unprecedented.

## Hardware requirements

* A Banana Pi M2 ZERO SBC (BPI-M2) (any model should be suitable, I have used one of simplest BPI-M2 ZERO)
* An 8GB (or larger) SD card 
* A power supply (PSU)
* A radiation detector [Banggood](https://www.banggood.com/sk/DIY-Geiger-Counter-Kit-Open-Source-Miller-Tube-GM-Tube-Module-Radiation-Parts-p-1937604.html?rmmds=myorder&cur_warehouse=CN) , as kit for more skils users, or on  [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32884861168.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.5faf6aa9OuQXsc)
* Some [Dupont cables/jumper jerky](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/jumper-jerky?variant=348491271) (you’ll need 3 female-female cables)


## Hardware connection

There are 3 connections we need to make from the radiation detector board to the BPI-M2 ZERO. They are +5V and Ground (GND) for power, and the output pulse line to detect the pulses generated by detection board. Note that this is called `VIN` which can be a bit confusing as this usually means ‘voltage input’ or something similar, but on this board, it’s the output.

In this configuration you only need to provide 5 volt power to one of the two boards; if you’re powering the Banana Pi with a standard micro-USB power supply, that will power the detector board via the connections we’ve just made, as well.

## Software setup

You have two options. The first (preferred) is to download a prepared image with preset values. Or install some debian based image on your BPI-M2 zero , install the necessary software components and run my python application, stored in src directory. The first option is the easiest.

### How to use image:

Just download [geiger.img](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pP6zhLzigkKEu4Vl4GHI0awQZ6XYNu6-/view?usp=sharing) and burn it on the SD card. To do it, You need some suitable sotware to upload the img to the sd card, for example [BalenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher), or [Win32DiskImager](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/), or something similar, or the dd command in Linux CLI:

*  sudo dd if=geiger.img of=/dev/mmcblkx                     * ;  mmcblkx must be repalced with appropriate name of sdcard on Your system
